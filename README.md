# Admission Webhook
This project is used to explore the implementation of a Kubernetes [admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks).

## Getting Started
To build the Docker image of the admission webhook server:
```
$ make image/build
```

To generate self-signed TLS artifacts:
```
# generate the self-signed CA
$ make tls/ca

# generate the TLS cert for the webhook server, signed by the custom CA
$ make tls/server
```

To run the admission webhook Docker conainer:
```
$ make container/run
```

Cleaning up the Docker container:
```
$ make container/clean
```
